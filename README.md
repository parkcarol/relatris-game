# Concept
Tetris is a game I like to play alone when I need to take a step back and recenter my mind.
Nature is a source I reach to when possible to so. With this in mind I incorporated nature to the game.

# Challenge
Enable a second player.

# Unsolved Problems
The second player feature is not working properly. Only the first session works.

# Future
- Add Responsive Web Design;
- Play relaxing music;
- Elaborate second-player code;
- Add the pause feature;
- Make it possible to view next piece;
- Refine visual interface.
